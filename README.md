### Introduction

The gut microbiome has a key role in human health and disease (Efimova et al. 2018). However, studying the complex structure and function of the gut microbiome through next generation sequencing is a challenging task and it results to reproducibility issues (Efimova et al. 2018)

### How the Efimova et al. 2018 sequenced the data

Here, Efimova et al. 2018 obtained cross-sectional colon biopsies and faecal samples from nine participants in their COLSCREEN study and sequenced them in high coverage using Illumina pair-end shotgun (for faecal samples) and IonTorrent 16S (for paired feces and colon biopsies) technologies (Efimova et al. 2018). The metagenomes consisted of between 47 and 92 million reads per sample and the targeted sequencing covered more than 300 k reads per sample across seven hypervariable regions of the 16S gene (Efimova et al. 2018). Their data is freely available and coupled with code for the presented metagenomic analysis using up-to-date bioinformatics algorithms (Efimova et al. 2018). These results will add up to the informed insights into designing comprehensive microbiome analysis and also provide data for further testing for unambiguous gut microbiome analysis (Efimova et al. 2018).
